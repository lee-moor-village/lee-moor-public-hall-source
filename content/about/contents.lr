The hall is run by the people of Lee Moor and surrounding villages. It's self funded so we have regular events to raise money. We have meetings every month that anyone is welcome to attend.  All catering and bar staff are voluntary and we are always happy to hear from anyone who might be interested in occasionally helping out.
